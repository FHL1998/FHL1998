excerpt: 'This paper explores using large language model (LLM) agents in industrial robotics, focusing on autonomous design, decision-making, and task execution. It introduces a framework with three key components: task-parameter matching, autonomous tool path design, and integration with robotic simulations. Results show GPT-4 excels in task planning, achieving an 81.88% success rate in simulations. The study highlights LLMsâ€™ potential in manufacturing and suggests future improvements like visual semantic control and real-time feedback.'
