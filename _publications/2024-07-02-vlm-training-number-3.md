This paper introduces an innovative training system for the Renishaw AM400 metal printer, leveraging the synergy of the advanced Vision Language Model (VLM) with Augmented Reality (AR) within the Digital Twins (DT) framework. Aimed at overcoming the limitations of conventional training methods in metal additive manufacturing (AM), our system integrates AR to provide an immersive learning environment, enhancing the real-world experience with interactive digital overlays. The core of the system lies in its use of VLM, which, pre-trained on diverse datasets, excels in processing multi-modal data, thereby offering nuanced and contextually relevant guidance for trainees. Key experiments demonstrate the system’s effectiveness, particularly highlighting the usage of VLM as an Artificial Intelligence (AI) agent to integrate external tools like YOLO-v7 for valve state classification and CRAFT for control panel text recognition. This approach significantly improves recognition accuracy, operational understanding, and human–machine interaction, especially for non-expert users, making complex metal AM operations more accessible. The research not only showcases the potential of AR and VLM in industrial training but also sets a new standard for smart manufacturing practices, indicating broader applications in various industrial domains.
