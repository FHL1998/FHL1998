Discover how a cutting-edge framework leverages digital twins, synthetic data, and AI to revolutionize knowledge capture in manufacturing. By combining multimodal knowledge graphs, retrieval-augmented generation, and mixed reality interfaces, this approach achieves over **90%** accuracy in operation recognition. It addresses key challenges in human-centric systems by making tacit manufacturing expertise accessible, actionable, and intelligent, as demonstrated through a metal additive manufacturing use case.
