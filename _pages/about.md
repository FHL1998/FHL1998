I am a third-year PhD candidate in Mechanical Engineering at the National University of Singapore (NUS). I earned my Master of Science degree from NUS and completed my Bachelor's degree in Mechatronic Engineering at Beijing Jiaotong University.

My research focuses on integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) and Digital Twins (DTs) to transform Autonomous Manufacturing processes, with particular emphasis on Additive Manufacturing applications. Through this work, I aim to develop next-generation manufacturing systems characterized by intelligent decision-making capabilities, adaptive processes, and self-optimization.

*"Engineering intelligence into every layer of manufacturing."*
