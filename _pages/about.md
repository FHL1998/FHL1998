I am a fourth-year PhD candidate in Mechanical Engineering at the National University of Singapore (NUS). I earned my Master of Science degree from NUS and completed my Bachelor's degree in Mechatronic Engineering at Beijing Jiaotong University. 

I'm under the supervision of [Prof. Jerry Fuh Ying SHI](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/me/staff/fuh-ying-hsi-jerry-2/) and [Prof. Wen Feng LU](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/me/staff/lu-wen-feng-2/) from NUS and [Prof. Bingbing Li](https://www.ecs.csun.edu/~bingbing/) at CSUN. Our group has also established collaborations with leading universities and agencies such as UCLA, the University of Wisconsin–Madison, Jönköping University, Cranfield University, and NASA JPL, as well as with industry partners including NVIDIA, Autodesk, and Renishaw.

My research focuses on integrating **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Digital Twins (DTs)** to transform Autonomous Manufacturing processes, with particular emphasis on **Additive Manufacturing (AM)** applications. I aim to develop next-generation manufacturing systems with intelligent decision-making capabilities, adaptive processes, and self-optimization. **I am actively seeking collaborative opportunities with researchers and institutions worldwide.**

I have actively served as a reviewer for over 40 journal and conference papers, including those submitted to Expert Systems with Applications, Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence, Scientific Reports, and conferences such as ASME IDETC-CIE.
